│              │                                                                                                                                                                                                │
│              │ - If the credit score is greater than or equal to 200, the loan is approved (&#x27;Y&#x27;).                                                                                                             │
│              │ - Otherwise, the loan is rejected (&#x27;N&#x27;).                                                                                                                                                       │
