# ğŸ§  Language Models

This repo collects my experiments with small and large language models â€“ fine-tuning, real-time inference, embeddings, and more.

New files and updates will be added as I explore different techniques! âœ¨

## ğŸ“Œ What's Inside?

ğŸ”¹ Fine-tuning transformer models (MiniLM, GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, etc.)  
ğŸ”¹ Agentic workflows with OpenAI and SLMs   
ğŸ”¹ Instruction-based learning & prompt engineering  
ğŸ”¹ Real-time inference & evaluation  
ğŸ”¹ Optimizations for Apple Silicon (MPS)
